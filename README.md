# tt-discord-bot

This will be a first attempt at a discord bot for personal/fun use.  It is meant to be a good practice of JS and working with various api's for different functions.  I will also be deploying it on my own services to get practice completing that sort of task as well.

## Features: 
###### *in work/TBD*
- Tell dad jokes on command
  - API: [Dad Jokes](https://dadjokes.io)
  - Subscribed through: [RapidAPI](https://www.rapidapi.com)
- Tell cat facts on demand
  - This won't be an API but rather an internal function and file with some random facts I can find
- Have a help menu
- Announce when new people enter the chat
  - Possibly pull a random fact to include when this happens?
- play the "repeat" game
  - turned off only by a command
- info menu?
